# Migrate to Ambient

## Download the migration tool

Per the [documented instructions](https://ambientmesh.io/docs/setup/sidecar-migration/#download-the-migration-helper), we can obtain the migration helper with:

```shell
curl -sL https://storage.googleapis.com/gloo-cli/install.sh | sh
```

The output tells us that we can add the `gloo` binary to our path with:

```shell
export PATH=$HOME/.gloo/bin:$PATH
```

The command comes with different options flag, but the general form of the command we will run is:

```shell
gloo ambient migrate
```

## Try the migration tool

Try the migration helper now:

```shell
gloo ambient migrate
```

Study the output:

  ‚úÖ Required CRDs installed: passed
```

This output should begin to provide a validation for our plan:

- Among other things, it validates Istio version and Cluster CNI compatibility.  If we had used too old a version of Istio, the tool would have raised a concern, and our first priority would be to ugprade Istio to a newer version.

- We also get a validation that all necessary CRDs are installed.  I assume the reference is to the Gateway API CRDs.

The tool also helps us look forward and tells us what's not yet in place:

- We haven't yet upgraded to ambient mode.  We're told to use the `--set profile=ambient` flag.
- ztunnel is not yet installed

Let's get to work.

## Upgrade Istio

### Upgrade the CNI to use the ambient profile:

```shell
helm upgrade istio-cni istio/cni -n istio-system \
  --set global.platform=k3d --set profile=ambient --wait
```

### Upgrade `istiod` with the ambient profile

```shell
helm upgrade istiod istio/istiod -n istio-system --set profile=ambient --wait
```

### Install ztunnel

```shell
helm install ztunnel istio/ztunnel -n istio-system --set global.platform=k3d --wait
```

### Validate the upgrade

List all Helm installations:

```shell
helm ls -A
```

The output should corroborate that all components are installed, along with their versions.

```console
NAME            NAMESPACE       REVISION        UPDATED                                 STATUS          CHART           APP VERSION
istio-base      istio-system    1               2025-06-04 15:01:02.654247 +0700 +07    deployed        base-1.26.1     1.26.1
istio-cni       istio-system    2               2025-06-05 11:34:51.192029 +0700 +07    deployed        cni-1.26.1      1.26.1
istiod          istio-system    2               2025-06-05 11:34:59.327015 +0700 +07    deployed        istiod-1.26.1   1.26.1
ztunnel         istio-system    1               2025-06-05 11:35:38.388524 +0700 +07    deployed        ztunnel-1.26.1  1.26.1
```

Next, list all pods in the `istio-system` namespace:

```shell
kubectl get pod -n istio-system
```

The output should indicate that the CNI agent, `ztunnel`, and `istiod` are all running:

```console
NAME                      READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
istio-cni-node-wsld7      1/1     Running   0          2m25s
istiod-86849665c6-87lvg   1/1     Running   0          2m17s
ztunnel-zkzn8             1/1     Running   0          99s
```

## Migration assistant, what's next?

This is a good time to re-run the migration tool to see where we stand:

```shell
gloo ambient migrate
```

The output has changed:

```console
‚Ä¢ Starting phase pre-reqs...
‚úÖ Phase pre-reqs succeeded!
  ‚úÖ Cluster CNI compatibility: passed
  ‚úÖ Istio version compatibility: passed
  ‚úÖ Multicluster usage compatibility: passed

‚ùå Phase cluster-setup failed!
  ‚úÖ Ambient mode enabled: passed

  ‚ùå Sidecars support ambient mode: failed. 7 errors occurred:

  ‚úÖ Required CRDs installed: passed
```

In ambient mode, sidecar workloads must be have the HBONE protocol enabled in order to communicate with sidecarless workloads.

In order to effect that change, the assistant instructs us to restart the pods that represent our workloads.

This is a good example of a step that we hadn't considered in our plan.

In scenarios where we expect to run a mix of workloads, some sidecar-based and others sidecarless, this step would be important.

Go ahead and heed the recommendation by restarting the workloads:

```shell
kubectl rollout restart deploy -n backend
```
And:

```shell
kubectl rollout restart deploy -n frontend
```

Note that the above are still running sidecars.

## Assistant, what's next?

You know the drill by now:

```shell
gloo ambient migrate
```

Here is the salient output:

```console
‚Ä¢ Starting phase deploy-waypoints...
‚ö† Phase deploy-waypoints has recommendations!
  üîÆ Namespace "backend" might require a waypoint for the following services:
     * Service "backend/details" selected workload apps/v1/Deployment/backend/details-v1 requires a waypoint:
         AuthorizationPolicy backend/details-authz requires a waypoint due to HTTP attributes (methods)

     * Service "backend/details-v1" selected workload apps/v1/Deployment/backend/details-v1 requires a waypoint:
         AuthorizationPolicy backend/details-authz requires a waypoint due to HTTP attributes (methods)

     * Service "backend/ratings" selected workload apps/v1/Deployment/backend/ratings-v1 requires a waypoint:
         AuthorizationPolicy backend/ratings-authz requires a waypoint due to HTTP attributes (methods)

     * Service "backend/ratings-v1" selected workload apps/v1/Deployment/backend/ratings-v1 requires a waypoint:
         AuthorizationPolicy backend/ratings-authz requires a waypoint due to HTTP attributes (methods)


  ‚Ñπ Generated waypoints written to /tmp/istio-migrate/recommended-waypoints.yaml
```

The assistant has validated our analysis that:

- The authorization policies on backend services require a waypoint.
- The authorization policy on frontend services do not necessitate a waypoint.

It's interesting that it hasn't determined that `reviews` needs a waypoint too, on account of its traffic policy.

On the other hand, it's awfully nice to see a generated waypoint provided by the assistant:

```shell
cat /tmp/istio-migrate/recommended-waypoints.yaml
```

Here is the generated waypoint, it's a Gateway resource:

```yaml
apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Gateway
metadata:
  name: waypoint
  namespace: backend
spec:
  gatewayClassName: istio-waypoint
  listeners:
  - name: mesh
    port: 15008
    protocol: HBONE
```

## Deploy the waypoint

Apply the recommended waypoint:

```shell
kubectl apply -f /tmp/istio-migrate/recommended-waypoints.yaml
```

Note however that just applying the waypoint does not also bind it to specific workloads.

Verify that the waypoint is present in the `backend` namespace:

```shell
istioctl waypoint list -n backend
```

Here is the output:

```console
NAME         REVISION     PROGRAMMED
waypoint     default      True
```
